        Strained yogurt, Greek yogurt,[2] yogurt cheese, sack yogurt or kerned
        yogurt is yogurt that has been strained to remove most of its whey,
        resulting in a thicker consistency than normal unstrained yogurt, while
        still preserving the distinctive sour taste of yogurt. Like many types,
        strained yogurt is often made from milk enriched by boiling off some
        water content, or by adding extra butterfat and powdered milk. In Europe
        and North America, it is often made from low-fat or fat-free cow's milk.
        In Iceland, a similar product named skyr is made.
